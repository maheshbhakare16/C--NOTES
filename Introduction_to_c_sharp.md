# C# Notes :<a name = "intro"></a>
C# is a programming language of .Net Framework.

Our C# tutorial includes all topics of C# such as first example, control statements, objects and classes, inheritance, constructor, destructor, this, static, sealed, polymorphism, abstraction, abstract class, interface, namespace, encapsulation, properties, indexer, arrays, strings, regex, exception handling, multithreading, File IO, Collections etc.

## What is C# :
C# is pronounced as "C-Sharp". It is an object-oriented programming language provided by Microsoft that runs on .Net Framework.
By the help of C# programming language, 

We can develop different types of secured and robust applications:

- Window applications
- Web applications
- Distributed applications
- Web service applications
- Database applications etc.
- 
C# is approved as a standard by ECMA and ISO. C# is designed for CLI (Common Language Infrastructure). CLI is a specification that describes executable code and runtime environment.

C# programming language is influenced by C++, Java, Eiffel, Modula-3, Pascal etc. languages.

# C# History <a name = "history"></a>
History of C# language is interesting to know. Here we are going to discuss brief history of C# language.

C# is pronounced as "C-Sharp". It is an object-oriented programming language provided by Microsoft that runs on .Net Framework.
Anders Hejlsberg is known as the founder of C# language.

It is based on C++ and Java, but it has many additional extensions used to perform component oriented programming approach.
C# has evolved much since their first release in the year 2002. 

It was introduced with .NET Framework 1.0 and the current version of C# is 5.0.

`Let's see the important features introduced in each version of C# are given below.`

## C# Features :<a name = "features"></a>

> 1) Simple

C# is a simple language in the sense that it provides structured approach (to break the problem into parts), rich set of library functions, data types etc.

> 2) Modern Programming Language

C# programming is based upon the current trend and it is very powerful and simple for building scalable, interoperable and robust applications.

> 3) Object Oriented

C# is object oriented programming language. OOPs makes development and maintenance easier where as in Procedure-oriented programming language it is not easy to manage if code grows as project size grow.

> 4) Type Safe

C# type safe code can only access the memory location that it has permission to execute. Therefore it improves a security of the program.

> 5) Interoperability

Interoperability process enables the C# programs to do almost anything that a native C++ application can do.

> 6) Scalable and Updateable

C# is automatic scalable and updateable programming language. For updating our application we delete the old files and update them with new ones.

> 7) Component Oriented

C# is component oriented programming language. It is the predominant software development methodology used to develop more robust and highly scalable applications.

> 8) Structured Programming Language

C# is a structured programming language in the sense that we can break the program into parts using functions. So, it is easy to understand and modify.

> 9) Rich Library

C# provides a lot of inbuilt functions that makes the development fast.

> 10) Fast Speed

The compilation and execution time of C# language is fast.
